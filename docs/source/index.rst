Documentation of the PDG API
============================

The PDG API provides programmatic access to the data published by the
Particle Data Group (PDG) in the *Review of Particle Physics*.

See section "Development status" below for a summary on what is available and what is still under development.
The data provided by the present version of the PDG API should not be used in scientific
publications without careful checking of every single data item retrieved from the
PDG API.
